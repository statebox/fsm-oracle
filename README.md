# Statebox's FSM-Oracle

A formally verified idris program that evaluates executions for finite state machines (FSM).

The program uses the input provided in `FSMSpec` (see below) to build the underlying graph of the FSM, and generates the free category on it using [idris-ct](https://github.com/statebox/idris-ct/). It then uses the initial state and path provided in the execution (call them `x` and `[x1, ... , xn]`, respectively) to evaluate the composition `idx;x1;...;xn`. It returns success or error depending if this defines a valid morphism in the free category or not.

The project uses [Typedefs](https://github.com/typedefs/typedefs) to encode types, which are serialized/deserialized in/from JSON.

## Installation

We use `elba` to download dependencies and compile the binary, just type:

```
$ elba install
```

This will install the binary in elba's binary folder. Typically `~/.elba/bin` if this folder is in your path you can simply call `fsm-oracle` to test it out.

You can find elba and instructions on how to install it on the [official repository](https://github.com/elba/elba).

## Usage
Just put your input (as specified below) in a file, for example `input.JSON`, and run:

```
fsm-oracle input.json
```

If the execution is valid, Idris will return a json output of the following form:

```javascript
{
"_0": {}
}
```

If the execution produces an error, the output will be:
```javascript
{
  "_1": {
    "inn" : {
      "_x": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Where `x` denotes an error code according to the following table:

|Error Code|Description|
|---|---|
|`0`| The FSM specification is invalid.   |
|`1`| The FSM state is invalid.   |
|`2`| The FSM path is invalid.   |
|`3`|Input cannot be parsed as JSON.   |
|`4`|Filesystem error: File cannot be read.   |
## Input format

Input has to be fed as JSON, and is converted to Idris terms and types through the use of [Typedefs](https://github.com/typedefs/typedefs). The Idris types for FSM executions are defined in the file `Tgraph.idr`.

The internal input format is a term of type `FSMExec`, and is of the form
`(FSMSpec, FSMState, FSMPath)`. It consists of three things: A specification of the FSM on which executions are run (`FSMSpec`), an initial state (`FSMState`), and a list of actions to evaluate (`FSMPath`).

#### `FSMSpec`
The type of `FSMSpec` is `(Nat,List (Nat Nat))`: The FSM is specified as a pair, where the first component denotes the number of states (vertexes) of the FSM, while the second is a list of pairs of vertexes (edgelist) denoting the possible actions.

For instance, `(5,[(2,1),(4,2),(0, 3)])` specifies a FSM having `5` vertexes, enumerated `0,1,2,3,4`, and three possible actions: One going from `2` to `1`, one going from `4` to `2` and one going from `0` to `3`.

The edgelist has to be in range as specified by the number of vertexes. As such, specifications such as `(5,[(7,1),(4,2),(0, 3)])`
or `(5,[(5,5)])` are considered invalid and will produce an error.

#### `FSMState`
The type of `FSMState` is `Nat`. This specifies an initial vertex from which the computation has to start.

The initial state has to be in range as specified by the number of vertexes in `FSMSpec`. So, for instance, `4` is a valid state for the FSM `(5,[(2,1),(4,2),(0, 3)])`, while `5` is not, and will produce an error.

#### `FSMPath`
The type of `FSMPath` is `List Nat`. It specifies a computation to evaluate.

Each number in the list has to be in range as specified by the length of the edgelist in `FSMSpec`. As such, `[1,0]` is a valid path for the FSM `(5,[(2,1),(4,2),(0, 3)])` (indicating to first use the action going from `4` to `2` and then the one going from `2` to `1`), while `[3]` is not.

#### Examples

The following define valid inputs:
```
((5, [(1,1),(3,4),(2,1)]) , 3, [1])
((5, [(1,1),(1,1),(2,1)]) , 2, [2,1,0])
```

The following define invalid inputs:

Invalid `FSMSpec`:
`((5, [(1,1),(5,4),(2,1)]) , 2, [2,0,1])`

Invalid `FSMState`:
`((5, [(1,1),(3,4),(2,1)]) , 6, [2,1,0])`

Invalid `FSMPath`:
`((3,[]), 1, [1])`

#### JSON Encoding

Terms of type `FSMSpec` as described above have to be fed as inputs, encoded in JSON format. The way JSON encoding is implemented can be found in the file `JSONFormat.idr`.

We do use the notation:

```javascript
{
  "_1":
  "_2":
  ...
  "_n":
}
```
To encode tuples, and the usual square bracket notation for lists. Pairs defining edges are encoded as:
```javascript
{
  "input":
  "output":
}
```
Where `input` and `output` specify the endpoints of the edge.

Applying these definitions recursively, any term of type `FSMExec` can be encoded. For example, the following is the JSON encoding of the input execution `((5, [(1,1),(3,4),(2,1)]) , 2, [2,0,0])`:


```javascript
{
  "_0": {
    "_0": 5,
    "_1": [
      {
       "input": 1,
       "output": 1
      },
      {
       "input": 3,
       "output": 4
      },
      {
       "input": 2,
       "output": 1
      }]
  },
  "_1": 2,
  "_2": [2, 0, 0]
}
 ```
