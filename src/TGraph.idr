||| The type definition for vertices in the graph is jsut

||| That there are 5 vertexes, denoted 0,1,2,3,4
FSMVertex : TDefR 3
FSMVertex = TNat

||| The type definition for edges in the graph is just a couple
||| of vertexes defining the edge source and target

||| A Finite State Machine is defined by its vertices and a list of edges
||| The definition might not be valid if edges endpoints are out of range
FSMSpec : TDefR 3

||| A state is a vertex in the graph (might be out of range)
FSMState : TDefR 3
FSMState = FSMVertex

||| A path is a list of edges (might not be valid)
FSMPath : TDefR 3
FSMPath =  RRef 2-- TList `ap` [FSMEdge]

||| An execution is a FSM, a state representing an inital edge and a path from that edge.
||| The execution might not be valid.
